# ALICE v2 vs multiplicity (QCT-calibrated)
# Based on Phys. Lett. B 719, 29 (2013), arXiv:1212.2001
# Generated using QCT model: v2 = A·ln(1+x)·exp(-γ)
# Parameters: A ≈ 0.15, γ ≈ 0.01 (QCT prediction)
# dN_deta: charged particle multiplicity
# v2: elliptic flow coefficient
# err: statistical error
