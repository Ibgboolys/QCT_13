#: description: Event multiplicity classes, their corresponding fraction of the INEL>0 cross-section and their corresponding average charged particle density at midrapidity ($|\eta|<0.5$). The value of in the inclusive (INEL>0) class is 5.96 $\pm$ 0.23. The uncertainties are the quadratic sum of statistical and systematic contributions.
