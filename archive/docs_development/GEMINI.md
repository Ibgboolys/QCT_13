# Gemini Project Context: QCT (Quantum Compression Theory)

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the QCT repository for AI-assisted development.

## 1. Project Overview

This repository contains the **Quantum Compression Theory (QCT)**, a theoretical physics research project. The project's goal is to develop a framework explaining fundamental physics phenomena based on a microscopic quantum neutrino condensate.

The project is a hybrid of:
*   **Scientific Manuscript:** A detailed paper authored in LaTeX.
*   **Numerical Simulations:** A suite of Python scripts for running simulations, performing calculations, and validating theoretical predictions.
*   **Extensive Documentation:** A large collection of Markdown files analyzing the theory, tracking progress, and documenting automation tools.

**Key Technologies:**
*   **Python 3.11+:** For all simulations and tooling. Core libraries include `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas`.
*   **LaTeX:** For the main scientific manuscript.
*   **Shell Scripts:** For automation.

## 2. Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several key directories:

*   `./`: The root contains many Markdown files for high-level analysis, status reports, and project management.
*   `simulations/`: Contains all Python scripts for numerical simulations and calculations. This is where most of the scientific coding happens.
*   `manuscripts/`: Holds the LaTeX source code for the scientific paper.
*   `docs/`: Contains a large collection of detailed analysis documents, derivations, and summaries in Markdown format.
*   `tools/`: Contains Python and shell scripts for automating repository tasks like documentation generation, data mining, and reorganization.
*   `results/`: Intended for output files, figures, and data generated by the simulations.
*   `docs_site/`: Contains the generated HTML documentation website (not checked into git).

## 3. How to Work with this Project

### Building the Documentation

The project includes a tool to build a local HTML documentation website from the various source files.

```bash
# Generate the documentation site
python tools/build_docs_site.py

# Open the main page in a browser
# (Path may vary depending on OS)
# On Linux:
# firefox docs_site/index.html
```

### Running Simulations

Simulations are individual Python scripts located in the `simulations/` directory. They should be executed directly.

```bash
# Example: Run a cosmological evolution simulation
python simulations/cosmological_evolution_with_sigma_max.py

# Example: Run a verification script
python simulations/verify_dark_energy_calculation.py
```

### Compiling the Manuscript

The main scientific paper is written in LaTeX.

```bash
# Navigate to the source directory
cd manuscripts/latex_source

# Compile the document (may require multiple runs)
pdflatex preprint.tex
bibtex preprint
pdflatex preprint.tex
pdflatex preprint.tex
```

### Running Automation and Validation

The `run_automation.sh` script in the root directory likely executes a series of checks, validations, and other tasks.

```bash
# Run the main automation script
bash run_automation.sh
```

## 4. Development and Testing Conventions

*   **Testing:** The presence of `pytest` in `requirements.txt` and a `.pytest_cache` directory indicates that `pytest` is the testing framework. Tests are likely located within the `simulations/` directory or a dedicated `tests/` subdirectory.
*   **Code Style:** The `requirements.txt` file lists `flake8`, `black`, and `pylint`. This suggests a strong emphasis on code quality and a standardized format. Before committing Python code, it should be checked with these tools.
*   **Git Branches:** The `README.md` specifies a branch naming convention: `claude/feature-description-<session-id>`.

This `GEMINI.md` file should serve as a starting point for understanding and interacting with this complex research repository.
